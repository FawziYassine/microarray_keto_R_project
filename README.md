# microarray_keto_R_project
<<<<<<< HEAD
In this project I assisted Gino Cortopassi (Professor at the Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California, Davis): 
1. Finding differentially expressed genes in Affymetrix microarray data generated from a study on mice fed a Ketogenic Diet
2. Enrichment Analysis of the Most Differentially Expressed Genes
(using KEGG and GO Databases)
