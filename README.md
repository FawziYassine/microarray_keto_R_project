# microarray_keto_R_project
In this project I assisted Gino Cortopassi (Professor at the Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of California at Davis) in
  1- Finding differentially expressed genes in Affymetrix microarray data generated from a study on mice fed a Ketogenic Diet 
  2- Annotating (Enrichment Analysis) those  genes with pathways from the GO and KEGG databases.
